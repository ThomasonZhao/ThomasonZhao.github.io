# Changyu (Thomason) Zhao

Hey! I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), class of 2025. I'm also a noob member of the [CTF](https://ctftime.org/about/) team [@r3kapig](https://r3kapig.com/). I love reverse engineering, pwning, hardware security, and computer systems in general. 

This is my technical blog. I post most of hacking-related things here, sometimes my personal thoughts. I hope you enjoy!
